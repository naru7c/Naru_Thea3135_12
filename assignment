The advertisement was part of a video created as a joint project with Japanese animators and Mcdonalds. 
The advertisements appelas to my emotions because it creates a sense of familliartiy and warmth with the
pastel colors and vibrant colors. It also shows warmth by displaying a young happy family eating together
making the space in the advertisement appear more welcoming. The advertisement makees me want to visit 
Mcdonalds with my family and freinds so that I can also feel that nostolgic feeling of going to 
Mcdoanlds as a kid.
